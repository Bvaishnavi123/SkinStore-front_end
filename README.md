This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. there were some more functionalities that could have been done, yeah the time didn’t permit us to go further. But we will surely improve it during the course of time in future .

## So jurney started from here!
As we have started our journey to learn full-stack web development at the Masai school, Whatever we have learned about these languages so far, we used. But I hope you would really appreciate the amount of precision and the perfectness we have achieved

# <span style="color:red">Our Journey: </span>
I would like to say that it is because of the effort that everyone put in. I and my wonderful teammates had, we able to achieve our goal. As part of Masai school, we have always believed that communication and skills are greater than knowledge so it is because of effective communication and sheer will to understand complicated things and make them simple to understand, that we were able to create the page with comparatively fewer resources.

# <span style="color:red">Challenges: </span>
We faced quite a few challenges while developing the clone. The challenges we can remember are as follows:-
<br>
Back-end code and Express packages were fairly new to us and thus it became a challenge to fetch the data of the back-end code and solve the errors. Sometimes we worked till 2 am just to debug the error and improve the final version afterward.
We had to learn how to make animations and carousels as a few sections of some pages required us to create image cards, moving navbar, and cart page.
we learned to use Authentication and validation in sign-up login, etc. Here, reading the documentation and looking at the snippets come in handy to solve such problems.
We faced a lot of challenges while getting a similar layout on different screen sizes. Also, we faced a lot of challenges in the deployment of backend code and connecting with front-end code

# <span style="color:red">Conclusion: </span>
We are very thankful for the support of my teammates and instructor for the completion of project in due time. We will looks forward to add some feature and functionality which we left in this project for future expensions.



# <span style="color:red">ENDING NOTE AND TAKEAWAYS: </span>
As mentioned earlier, we were able to attain the required layout because of the communication that we maintained. The command chain that we follow and the level of understanding about the topic we had. I felt proud to work with such amazing people and represent the team in the evaluation. This project could not have been made possible without the contribution of all the group members
